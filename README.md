# Timer CLI app
the `cli` app is kinda easy to use you just need to navigate by using arrow keys or vim keys

and its simple am still working on it and making it looking better

### what am looking to add:
 - a progress bar to the Timer
 - prettier look by adding colors and other things

##### am still a beginner in c++ and c low level coding and am still learning it until when i can make an operating system in C
